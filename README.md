Smart Traffic Light Controller 🚦
A Python-based simulation project that manages traffic signals dynamically based on real-time traffic density inputs.

💡 Project Overview
This project simulates an intelligent traffic management system using Python. The system:

Accepts traffic density input from users for each direction (North, East, South, West).
Adjusts the traffic light cycle (Green, Yellow, Red) dynamically based on vehicle count.
Runs infinitely to simulate real-world signal control.
📌 Features
Console-based simulation
Dynamic adjustment of signal timings based on density
Object-oriented design with classes (TrafficLight, TrafficManagementSystem)
Uses real-time input and time.sleep() for timing simulation
🔧 Technologies Used
Python 3.x
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
Console Input/Output
