<h1> Smart Traffic Light Controller 🚦</h1>
A Python-based simulation project that manages traffic signals dynamically based on real-time traffic density inputs.
<br>
💡 Project Overview
<br>
This project simulates an intelligent traffic management system using Python. The system:
<br>
Accepts traffic density input from users for each direction (North, East, South, West).
<br>
Adjusts the traffic light cycle (Green, Yellow, Red) dynamically based on vehicle count.
  <br>
Runs infinitely to simulate real-world signal control.
  <br>
<h2>📌 Features</h2>
  <br>
<p>  
Console-based simulation
Dynamic adjustment of signal timings based on density
Object-oriented design with classes (TrafficLight, TrafficManagementSystem)
Uses real-time input and time.sleep() for timing simulation

<h3>🔧 Technologies Used</h3>

Python 3.x<br>
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
<br>
Console Input/Output
